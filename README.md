# 🌐 Building a Network with Packet Tracer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents my experience designing and configuring a network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes:
- Setting up network devices (routers, switches, PCs, etc.).
- Assigning IP addresses and configuring subnets.
- Ensuring proper connectivity with routing and VLANs.
- Testing and troubleshooting network performance.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand the basics of networking and topology design.
- Gain hands-on experience configuring devices in Packet Tracer.
- Learn fundamental networking concepts like IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.
- Troubleshoot and resolve connectivity issues.
